# Ruby Scripts

This collection includes different scripts that I use to monitor my progress as I learn Ruby programming.


**Name Modification**: Is an interactive program that allows a user to input their name and select a casing option from a predefined list. After entering their name, the program prompts the user to choose a casing style, such as lowercase, UPPERCASE, camelCase, snake_case, or kebab-case. The selected casing style is then applied to the user's name, and the modified name is displayed as output.

**URL Shortener**: This program enables users to input a URL. It validates whether the entered text is a valid URL running on HTTP or HTTPS. Upon confirmation of a valid link, the program shortens the URL to a minimum of 40 characters. Consequently, when users enter the shortened URL, it directs them to the same website.
